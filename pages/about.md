<p> Self Learning Data Engineering is hard when you want to move from different domain, especially not from the computer science background. As a person from Mechanical Engineering background I went through the process of learning(Still learning) the jargons of Data Engineering. <br>

I want to debunk all the techical terms in a understanble way and make the transition process smooth. There are lot of terminologies and tools involved in Data Engineering, once the basics are well understood, it can be used in different applications. <br>

Example terminologies which I dont have any idea about before my Data journey are API, SQL, Clusters, Servers, SSH, Virtual Machines and so on, similarly on the tools as well. I know a little bit of programming in Fortran but never tried Python, SQL, dont even know about Object Orientied programming.
